As we currently jointly pursue investor capital as well as FDA approval for our innovative medical device, you can help us reach our funding goals by making a pre-order or purchase from our website's online store below. Also we are offering a limited-time option for the public to purchase shares of company stock to help us quickly reach our funding goals. This presents the rare potential to join our company in progressing both the business objective of obtaining a massive return on investment while also advancing the humanitarian objective by making our solution more ubiquituous - which should make us rich while we historically remove opioid overdose from the major causes of death worldwide.</p>
